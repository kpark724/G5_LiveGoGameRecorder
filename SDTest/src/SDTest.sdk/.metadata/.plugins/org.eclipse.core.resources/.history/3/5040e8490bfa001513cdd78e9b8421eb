/*
*   Everytime vdma_1 reads from the StoneDetect IP, the IP changes one of its register value to the next stone.
*   It is assumed that IP is outputting the result by traversing through column first and then row (row: outer loop, col: inner loop)
*   Therefore, the memory will be stored with 361 2-bit information, which must be translated into sgf file format.
*   361 * 2 bits / 8 bits per byte = 90.25 bytes ~= 91 bytes
*   91 bytes ~= 23 DWORD
